# Brand Guidelines: Ghazi - Production AI Engineer

## Selected Layout Concept: "The Geometric Architect"

**Reference Style:** 21st.dev "Bento" or Linear.app.

**Visuals:** Dark mode, grid lines, highly structured.

**Why:** It avoids the "generic bootcamp" look and feels like a dashboard for a senior engineer.

## 1. Core Identity
* **Archetype:** The "Architect-Engineer." Structured, reliable, production-grade.
* **Tagline:** "From Blueprints to Neural Pipelines."
* **Voice:** Technical, concise, confident. Avoid marketing fluff (e.g., "Passionate about AI"). Use engineering terms (e.g., "Scalable," "Containerized," "Low-Latency").

## 2. Visual Language
* **Theme:** "Dark Industrial."
    * Background: `#09090b` (Zinc-950)
    * Cards/Blocks: `#18181b` (Zinc-900) with 1px borders `#27272a` (Zinc-800).
    * Accent: `#3b82f6` (Blue-500) for primary actions, but used sparingly.
* **Typography:**
    * Headings: **Inter** (Bold, tight tracking).
    * Code/Technical details: **JetBrains Mono** or **Geist Mono** (for that "developer tool" feel).
* **Layout Structure (Bento Grid):**
    * Content should be organized in distinct rectangular tiles.
    * Example: A large square tile for the "Hero/Bio", a wide rectangular tile for "Tech Stack", vertical tiles for "Projects".

## 3. Imagery
* **Profile Photo:** Use high-contrast black & white or desaturated color to match the industrial theme.
* **Project Thumbnails:** Do not use generic stock AI robots. Use:
    * Architecture diagrams (Mermaid.js style).
    * Terminal screenshots.
    * Code snippets in a nice window frame.

## 4. Logo Usage
* Use the geometric "G-Frame" logo (SVG provided).
* Place in top-left, strictly aligned with the grid layout.
